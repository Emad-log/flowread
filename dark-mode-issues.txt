Dark mode issues found in Settings screen:
1. Statistics numbers (0, 0, 0s) are not visible - text is dark on dark background
2. WPM number (300) is not visible - text is dark on dark background  
3. About section text is not visible
4. The +/- buttons show as empty circles (text not visible)
5. "Settings" title at top is not visible

The issue is that the colors.foreground is not being properly applied in dark mode.
The theme config shows foreground dark should be #FFFFFF but it's showing as black.

This is likely because the useColors hook is not getting the updated colorScheme from the context.
